We have a [documentation](https://polyaxon.com/docs/) that covers how to install and use Polyaxon.
Our code is open-source and can be found [here](https://polyaxon.com/docs/).
You can also check this [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iexwrka_hys)
from PyData about how to scale deep and reproduce deep learning on Kubernetes with Polyaxon.
