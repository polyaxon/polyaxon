## v0.0.9

  * Optimize build process and handle concurrent build of the same repo: this will fix issues related to experiment getting stack in the build process and sometimes preventing the iterative hyperparameters algorithms from continuing the search.
  * Add advanced nodes scheduling for experiments and jobs: Previously users could set a default node selectors for core and experiments. Now they have the ability to override these selectors per experiment, experiment job for distributed runs, notebook, and tensorboard.
  * Fix upload command on Windows platform
  * Add more edge cases handling for resumed experiments
    * deleting original should delete resumed experiments
    * resuming a resumed experiment should resume the original experiment
  * Fix issue with stopping experiment groups
  * Add NFS provisioner, this is practical for testing the platform without the need to create a real NFS server.
  * Add event management and backbone for creating notifications and integrations
  * Add tracker
  * Add activity log
  * Update docs requirement

## v0.0.8

  * Add restart/resume/copy experiments
  * Fix issue with cyclic redirection when the user's session is expired.
  * Add platform logging
  * Update Bayesian optimization
  * Fix prospector for tests
  * Remove requirement for project name in specifications
  * Add google GKE tutorial

## v0.0.7

  * This new version has breaking changes:
  * Update specification
    * Add kind section to indicate the type of operation to run on Polyaxon.
    * Rename sequential search to grid search
    * Update early stopping schema to use optimization instead of higher: maximize | minimize
    * Move matrix to settings
    * Add config for search algorithms to settings
    * Remove run_type and export strategies form settings
    * All early_stop to stop both individual experiment from running or an experiment group or both.
    * Rename steps to build_steps in run section
    * Rename concurrent_experiment to concurrency
    * Add new method for sampling values
    * Possibilty to provide a seed
    * Rename Sequential search to grid search
  * Add new hyperparameters search algorithms:
    * Add hyperband
    * Add bayesian optimization [alpha]
  * Add continuous methods for sampling matrix params:
    * pvalues
    * uniform
    * quniform
    * loguniform
    * qloguniform
    * normal
    * qnormal
    * lognormal
    * qlognormal
  * Add first version of pipelines.
  * Show logs after experiment is finished [api, ui, client, cli].
  * Optimize plugin jobs [tensorboards and notebooks].
  * Separate dahsboard and runner.
  * Fixed bug issues.

## v0.0.6

 * Enhance single experiment spawner
 * Add MXNet spawner and support for distributed MXNet experiments
 * Add Pytorch spawner and support for distributed Pytorch experiments
 * Add Horovod spawner and support for distributed Horovod experiments [WIP]
 * Optimize Tensorflow spawner and distributed Tensorflow experiments
 * Optimize schedulers' logic
 * Optimize docker build process

## v0.0.5

 * Add early stopping and number of experiments
 * Use statuses for jupyter notebooks and tensorboards
 * Fix issue with starting multiple tensorboards
 * Rename deleted status to stopped
 * Add admin dashboard

## v0.0.4

 * Add Jupyter notebooks
 * Update Tensorboard deployments
 * Apply project permission to project plugin jobs, i.e. tensorboard and notebooks will only be accessible to users with enough project permissions
 * Update dashboard and ui
 * Fix some issues with Kubernetes resources tracking

## v0.0.3

## v0.0.2
