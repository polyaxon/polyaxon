## v1.10.0 [WIP]

### Agent

 * **Enhancement**: Several performance enhancements.

### CLI

 * **Enhancement**: Add missing commands for setting/updating the stage of a component/model version.

### Core

 * **New**: Add support for annotations in the connections specification.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve sidecar files watcher.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve sidecar sync logic to handle deletion.
 * **Enhancement**: Add support for delayed validation to all types to allow using jinja operations in params.
 * **Enhancement**: `as_arg` Should only convert bool parameters to `--PARAM` if the `isFlag` is defined to keep consistent behavior between using the "{{ PARAM }}" and "{{ params.PARAM.as_arg }}".
 * **Enhancement**: Improve `Query` manager to allow `params`/`inputs` to use full comparison operators.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve `Query` manager of datetime formats.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve `Query` manager to detect if it should filter by a date instead of a datetime.  

### Streams

 * **Enhancement**: Improve exceptions handling and APIs speed.

### UI

 * **New**: Allow multiple dashboard layouts in the comparison table:
   * Allow fixed and vertical layouts. 
   * Allow to hide/show the comparison table when the visualizations mode is enabled.
 * **New**: Add new advanced filters, allow filtering the runs in the comparison table based on:
   * parallel coordinate.
   * histogram.
   * activity calendar.
   * custom visualizations.
 * **New**: Add quick filters based on agents, queues, and projects.
 * **New**: Allow to filter based on humanized dates and add filters for datetimes.
 * **New**: Allow to filter based on resources (Memory/CPU/GPU/Custom) and cost.
 * **Enhancement**: Make search configuration durable using URL query params.
 * **Enhancement**: Make dashboard configuration durable using URL query params.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve dashboards in comparison table.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve graph view rendering speed.
 * **Enhancement**: Use the new virtualized cell rendering to speedup rendering of the comparison table with large number of columns and rows and the logs table.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve log streaming and the log viewer rendering speed.
 * **Enhancement**: Enable auto-scroll behavior and remove pagination in the logs viewer.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve download CSV functionality to allow downloading the complete values in a query.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve scrolling behavior in all pages.
 * **Fix**: Logs viewer scrollbar adding an extra horizontal scrolling.

### Deployment & Setup

 * **Enhancement**: Deactivate `compressedLogs` by default.

### House Keeping

 * **Enhancement**: Upgrade base images and remove info issues.

### Commercial

 * **New**: Add an initial version of resources aware queues.
   * This feature should allow setting a new restriction on the queue concurrency based on CPU/GPU/TPU/Memory... of the runs attached to it.
 * **New**: Add an initial version of cost aware queues.
   * This feature should allow setting a new restriction on the queue concurrency based on the cost of the runs attached to it.
 * **New**: Allow to assign cost estimation to operations.
 * **New**: Add cost and resources consumption to analytics.
 * **New**: Allow full filtering capabilities in analytics.
 * **New**: Allow filtering activity logs by time.
 * **New**: Allow downloading the activity logs archive.
 * **Enhancement**: Update agent controller to schedule nested pipelines lazily.
 * **Enhancement**: Separate concurrency limits of parent pipelines and nested pipelines to avoid deadlocks.
 * **Enhancement**: Show concurrency usage in pricing page.
 * **Enhancement**: Investigate the new `suspend` feature to provide immediate concurrency change instead of the current [draining logic](/faq/How-does-changing-concurrency-work/).
